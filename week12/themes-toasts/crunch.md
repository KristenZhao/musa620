# Cinnamon Toast Crunch

## "The Taste You Can See"

Originally the cereal featured plain squares but currently features artificial 
"cinnamon swirl" coloration in each piece. The cereal was originally invented 
and marketed by General Mills Assistant Product Manager, Elisabeth Trach. 
Starting in 1986 there were three animated bakers as the mascots, none of which 
were originally named; the two besides Wendell are sometimes incorrectly 
credited as Bob and Quello. The other two bakers were considerably more youthful
in appearance than Wendell. Quello, who was Wendell's second-in-command, was 
tall and thin with brown hair, and Bob, the youngest of the group, had black 
hair and a stocky build. According to an inquiry response from General Mills 
Customer Service:

"These little guys were cute bakers complete with chef hats and aprons. Wendell
was the only baker that was named, and due to consumer feedback, we chose to 
feature him as the 'Cinnamon Toast Baker' where he has remained in this title 
role since 1991."
