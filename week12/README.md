## Assignment

Create a Shiny app which is hosted on http://www.shinyapps.io/. The app should
have multiple pages or tabs. It should include an interactive map. If you have
questions about using Shiny please don't hesitate to get in touch with me. Two
**tips** for making your app:

1. Don't start from scratch. Use one of my examples to start off.
2. Test your app as your build it. Make small, incremental changes then run your
app as often as is reasonable, that way if you break something about your app
you can diagnose the problem quickly.
